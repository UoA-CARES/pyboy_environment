## Installation Instructions

`git clone` the repository into your desired directory on your local machine

Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the **root directory** of the package

To make the module **globally accessible** in your working environment run `pip3 install --editable .` in the **project root**

## Usage
This package provides the baseline code for the pyboy environments - you run these envrionments through gymnasium_envrionment.

`train.py` takes in hyperparameters that allow you to customise the training run enviromment â€“ OpenAI or DMCS Environment - or RL algorithm. Use `python3 train.py -h` for help on what parameters are available for customisation.

An example is found below for running on the pyboy environments with TD3 through console
```
python3 train.py run --gym pyboy --task mario TD3
```
